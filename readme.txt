Web Tool for GMing Empty Epsilon games

Currently heavily in progress
It is intended to have some utilities which work with any script and some
just with Xansta's sandbox https://github.com/Xansta/EEScenarios
Currently there isnt any checking as to if the sandbox is loaded, so expect issues
without it.

this directory should be copied into the EE www directory
inside of this directory the EE resources directory should be copied
if the resources is inconsistant between EE and this directory there are likely to be issues
